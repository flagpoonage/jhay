        <p>I communicate with business stakeholders and familiarize myself with the good, the bad, and the ugly in their day-to-day roles. I architect and present software solutions to their business problems. I build and run teams of Engineers, and occassionally, I get a chance to write great code.</p>

        <h3>Employment History</h3>
        <article>
          <h4>Senior User Interface Manager at Oldendorff Carriers</h4>
          <span class="employment-date">February 2019 - Current</span>
          <p>My management responsibilites primarily covered both the user interface team and our front-end product, for the internal data science platform.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Founded the front-end team of the data science department, and evangelized user interface development to team members, department heads and other business stakeholders</li>
            <li>Proactively met with members of commercial teams to understand their problems and design capable software solutions</li>
            <li>Coordinated frequently with other engineering managers to present my architecture proposals and integrate their solutions into the front-end</li>

            <li>Ran the hiring and salary negotiation process for the additional team members of the front-end team</li>
            <li>Set timelines and work priorities for the team using Agile methodologies</li>
            <li>Set unique KPI's and other goals for each team member</li>
          </ul>
          <hr class="responsibility-boundary" />
          <p>As a technical lead for the data sciece platform, I architected and created notable solutions to unique problems within our domain</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Designed and built a custom set of React tooling around the Mapbox library, by directly manipulating the root Mapbox component with a combination of custom event emitters and React hooks. The solution matched the functionality of other open source libraries such as react-map-gl and react-mapbox-gl, but also provided pragmatic React-based access to a fine-grained level of interactive control that was required in our extensive use of GIS information</li>
            <li>Designed the architecture for a front-end heavy data investigation system within our platform named "QPD" (Query-Pivot-Dashboard). The "Query" part of the solution is visually analagous to a GUI SQL builder, but utilizes the functionality of the Javascript language to connect diverse data sources both in memory and via API endpoints. The resulting dataset of a query is then piped to a fully customizable pivot table. The expressive combinations of these data investigation technologies, can be utilized repeatedly, and placed into a dashboard, allowing end-users to create their own unique view of the world, for them or their team</li>
          </ul>

            <li>Managed the QA team to ensure that our engineering approach was balanced between feature development, and maintenance</li>
            <li>Ran interviews for engineering candidates</li>
